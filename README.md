### **Company Background**

AltiQ hardware is a company which has grown vastly in the recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company which sells, computer and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

- Retailers
- Direct
- Distributors

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Problem Statement**
AtliQ is one of the fastest-growing companies in the electronic goods market. However, a recent expansion into Latin America led to heavy losses due to intuition-based decisions and limited Excel-based analysis.

To avoid repeating such costly mistakes, AtliQ has onboarded a data analytics team to drive data-informed decisions and bring transparency across the organization. The need is urgent, especially with rising competition from Dell, a company leveraging advanced analytics to gain market advantage.

So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building their analytics team for data driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry.

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Objective**

This project is expected to improve transparency and enable data-driven decision-making across markets and functions, thereby delivering a quantitative benefit of 10% incremental profit.

Currently, analytics maturity varies across regions â€” with strong usage in markets like the USA and India, but limited adoption in others such as South America and parts of Europe. The goal is:

- To implement enterprise-wide business intelligence and enable quick, actionable insights across all markets.

- To build a fully functional dashboard that can be used in business review meetings and decision-making processes â€” including customer negotiations, new product launches, marketing promotions, and finance budgeting.

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Hopes**

- **Data-Driven Decision Making** - AtliQâ€™s top priority is to move away from intuition-based decisions and embrace data as the primary driver of business strategy. Past decisions â€” like the costly failure of the Virginia store launch â€” were made without strong data backing. The goal is for data to tell the story and reflect the true state of the business, rather than relying on assumptions or personal opinions.

- **Effective Communication** - Currently, top executives depend on fragmented reports and inconsistent updates from regional managers. These often lack clarity and can be biased. The hope is to establish a centralized dashboard that delivers clear, real-time business insights â€” eliminating the need for constant follow-ups and lengthy email chains. This will improve transparency and significantly reduce communication overhead.

- **Avoid Manual Work** - Much of the current reporting involves collecting, cleaning, and emailing Excel files manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. By centralizing data into a single automated dashboard, AtliQ aims to eliminate repetitive manual tasks and free up time for deeper business analysis.

- **Transparency in Data** - A unified, organization-wide analytics platform will ensure that all stakeholders are looking at the same version of the truth. This transparency will reduce miscommunication, improve trust in numbers, and support consistent decision-making across markets.

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Potential Challenges**

- **Data Correctness and Completeness** - One of the major concerns is that any error in the dashboard â€” whether it's using incorrect data sources or misapplied formulas in Power BI â€” could lead to a false representation of business performance. This can result in poor decisions with significant consequences. Ensuring data accuracy, validation, and completeness is critical to avoid misleading insights and maintain stakeholder trust.

- **Feature Creep** - Continuous addition of new feature requests from stakeholders may delay the project, introduce bugs, and reduce overall quality. Maintaining a clear scope and prioritization framework will be essential to keep the project on track.

- **Resource Shortage** - While the current scope appears manageable, unexpected complexity or new requirements may require additional resources or extended timelines. If this arises, it will be communicated early to allow for proper planning and adjustment.

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Expected Success Outcome**

The project is expected to enable AtliQ to identify underperforming regions and implement focused strategies, resulting in a significant increase in sales across previously low-growth markets. By leveraging real-time insights and optimizing operational costs, the company aims to improve its profit margin by 10%. The ability to track, analyze, and reduce unnecessary expenses through the dashboard will empower data-driven efficiency and smarter decision-making across all functions.

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Questions to ask before starting with dashboard**

Project kick off session, where you should get clear of for what and why this project and all other questions you have with regards to the project.

- What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
- In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
- What will be time dead-line of the project?
- do the stakeholders expecting pre-view before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?

- is there any inputs from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?

&nbsp;

*******************
### **Dataset Understanding**

After the project kickoff meetings, the data engineering team granted access to the data catalog for the data analytics team.
AtliQ maintains a data catalog that lists all available databases and the respective data engineers responsible for each. These databases contain multiple tables, each holding different types of data.

Based on the requirements for the analytics dashboard, the data analytics team identified that they would need access to the **GDB041** and **GDB056** databases.
The next step for the data engineering team is to grant access to these specific datasets for the analytics team. These are **MySQL** databases.

**Dimension table** : It will have the static data like details of customer and products.

**Fact table** : It will have the data about the transactions. 

&nbsp;
 
#### **gdb041**: 
This database contains dimension tables such as Dim_Customer, Dim_Product, and Dim_Market and fact tables such as Fact_Forecast_Monthly and Fact_Sales_Monthly. Letâ€™s explore them - 

&nbsp;

**dim_customer** 

| Column Name   | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| customer    | **76** distinct and **20** unique customers throughout the market |
| Market  | **27** distinct and **1** unique markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain) |
| Platform  | **2** distinct platforms â€“ Brick & Mortar, E-commerce |
| Channel | **3** distinct channels â€“ Retailer, Direct, Distributors |
| customer_code | **209** distinct and unique customer code |

&nbsp;

**dim_market** 

| Column Name | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| market    | **27** distinct & unique markets |
| sub_zone | **7** distinct & **1** unique sub-zones |
| region  | **4** distinct regions - APAC, EU, nan and LATAM |

&nbsp;

**dim_product** 

| Column Name   | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Product_code    | **397** distinct & unique product code |
| Division  | **3** distinct divisions - N & S, P & A, PC|

&nbsp;
    
**fact_forecast_monthly -** Contains historical and current monthly-level forecasts. This table is used to forecast the customerâ€™s need in advance, which can help in -
            
- Higher customer satisfaction.
- Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purpose.
- The table is denormalized by data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.
- All the date of the month will be replaced by the start date of the month.
- It will have all the column names and in the end it will have the forecast quantity need of the customer.

| Column Name   | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| date | **397** distinct & unique product code |
| Product_code | **3** distinct divisions - N & S, P & A, PC |
| customer_code | **6** distinct segments - Accessories, Desktop, Networking, Notebook, Peripherals, Storage |
| forecast_quantity | There are **14** different categories, Like Internal HDD, keyboard |

&nbsp;

**fact_sales_monthly -** Contains up-to-date sales data at the monthly level. This table is largely similar to the fact_forecast_monthly table, but the last column contains actual sold quantity instead of forecasted values.

| Column Name   | Description |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| sold_quantity | **397** distinct & unique product code |

&nbsp;

#### **gdb056**
This database contains dimension tables such as freight_cost, gross_price, manufacturing_cost, Pre_invoice_dedutions and Post_invoice_deductions. Letâ€™s explore them - 

&nbsp;

**freight_cost** - This table has details of travel cost and other cost for each market with fiscal year.

**gross_price** - Contains gross price details for each product, with data aggregated at the fiscal year level.

**manufacturing_cost** - Contains manufacturing cost details by product code, with data available at the fiscal year level.

**Pre_invoice_dedutions** - Contains the pre-invoice deduction percentages for each customer, with data recorded at the fiscal year level.



**Post_invoice_deductions** - Contains details of Post invoice deductions and other deductions, with data available at the monthly level.

&nbsp;

As the database is **MySQL** in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential.

Later, the stakeholders provided a **Target File (.xlsx format)** and **Market Share File (.xlsx format)** directly to the data analytics team, with the goal of incorporating both into the Power BI dashboard.

**Target file (targets.xlsx) :**

This dataset outlines **country-level sales targets on a monthly basis**. For each market this file provides:

**ns_target :** Net Sales Target â€“ The sales volume expected for the month.

**gm_target :** Gross Margin Target â€“ The expected profit before operating expenses.

**np_target :** Net Profit Target â€“ The final target profit after all costs.

&nbsp;

**Market Share File (marketshare-v2022.xlsx) :**

This dataset will contribute to the Executive View. This file provides the following details:

**sub_zone :** Represents regions like North America, India, ROA, etc.

**category :** Covers categories such as Business Laptop, Personal Laptop, Gaming Laptop, and Personal Desktop.

**total_market_sales_$ :** Total sales figures for each product category per sub-zone, reported in millions of dollars.

**atliq_sales_$ :** Sales done by AtliQ in that category and zone.

**dale_sales_$, innovoo_sales_$, pacer_sales_$, bp_sales_$ :** Sales figures of major competitors.

**others_sales_$ :** Combined sales from smaller or miscellaneous competitors.
